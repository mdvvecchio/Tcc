### Objetives

The objectives of this project with say before is automation operatios to trains toys using bluetooth and android aplications. The work will be subdivided in four task forces.

###Android Team 
Your responsabiliti is aplication android development. The aplication will control the lights front and back with on / off and intensity.

Control motor velocity


###Microcontroler Team
Your responsabiliti is develop microcontroler software. This software suporting android aplication intermediation software and hardware

###Eletronics Team 
Your responsabiliti is develop eletronic circuit to control a motor and leds with pwm.

###Scientific Team and Documentation

Any team has responsabilities write the text then describe our work, your teory and the results


### The Code

before this work we has the similiar project, for inicial development we can use with model the codes that are on folder microcontrollers, android.

And sketchs the eletronic circuits are save onde folder Circuits.
